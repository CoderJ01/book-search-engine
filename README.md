# Book Search Engine

## Purpose
This website is designed to allow users to to search for books. When a search term for the input field is entered and the submit button is clicked, then several search results are displayed, featuring information on the book, such as the title author and description. When thr Login/Signup button is pressed, then a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to sign up or log in. When the toggle is set to Login, then three inputs - username, email address, and password - along with a signup button are presented. When the toggle is set to Signup, then two inputs - username, and password - along with a login button are presented.
<!-- When the user enters a valid email address and creates a password and click on the signup button, then the user's account is created and said user is logged into the site. When the user enters the email address and password for his account and clicks on the login button, then the modal closes and the user is logged into the site. When the user is logged in to the iste, then the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see the user's saved books, and Logout. When the Save button is clicked on a book, then the book's informtaion is onto the user's account. When the user clicks on the Remove button on a book, the book is deleted from the user's saved book list. When the user clicks on the Logout button, then he is logged out of the page -->
